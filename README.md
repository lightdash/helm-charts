# Lightdash helm-charts


# Development

It is recommended to work on this project with VS Code, as the development environment is pre-configured in a [development container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/create-dev-container).

## Linting
  `ct lint --all`

## ðŸš§ WARNING ðŸš§

Please be advised that these helm charts are under rapid development and will be refactored in the very near future.

It is recommended that you use this repository to generate and customize your own manifests (possibly using [helm template](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_template/) until the charts stabilize).
